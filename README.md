## Roadmap
So many things to take us to a solid 1.0. Lots of cool features suggested by the TAG game-design crew and the main goals I started this mod with. I'll try to map it up, but I'm open to being flexible.

 * [ ] Finish the board heirarchy [18]
  * [ ] This means the tournament board (including [28])

## Other Chess in Minecraft
I'll post these as I find them or they're brought to my attention:
 * https://github.com/AtomicBlom/ChessMod (unsure where it's at, didn't find docs, found it by accident for obv reasons)
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6M3kYEBG9Y (vanilla 1.8 via commandblock, no check/checkmate)
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rivY2fboL9A (vanilla 1.8 via commandblock, rougher, but had good explanation)
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RovJnqNbM (vanilla 1.14 via commandblock (I think), has world download, modern. 3:30, you can't castle through check!)
