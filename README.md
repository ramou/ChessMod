# ChessMod
Adding Pippin Barr's Chesses to minecraft.

## Playing it
You can grab the current version of the mod in the [mod folder](forge-1.14.4-28.2.0-mdk/mod).

You cab grab the current version as an instance that can be imported with something like MultiMC in the [modpack folder](modpack)

## Roadmap
So many things to take us to a solid 1.0. Lots of cool features suggested by the TAG game-design crew and the main goals I started this mod with. I'll try to map it up, but I'm open to being flexible.

### 0.7
Focus on low-level mechanics for the chessboard.
 * [ ] Finish the board heirarchy [18]
  * [ ] This means the tournament board (including [28])

  * [ ] This means a Chesses board (with no Chesses)
  * [ ] This means an AI board (with no AI)

### 0.8
Focus on feedback, core visuals and optimizing the code/textures around visuals
 * [ ] Make the Patchouli book for chesses [26]
 * [ ] Add orientation to the board [23] [24]

 * [ ] Visuals code cleanup [12] [9] (and maybe [2])

### 0.9
Focus on AI, future AI integration, general code cleanup and groundwork for Chesses integration
 * [ ] Make an AI that can beat someone

## Other Chess in Minecraft
I'll post these as I find them or they're brought to my attention:
 * https://github.com/AtomicBlom/ChessMod (unsure where it's at, didn't find docs, found it by accident for obv reasons)
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6M3kYEBG9Y (vanilla 1.8 via commandblock, no check/checkmate)
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rivY2fboL9A (vanilla 1.8 via commandblock, rougher, but had good explanation)
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RovJnqNbM (vanilla 1.14 via commandblock (I think), has world download, modern. 3:30, you can't castle through check!)
